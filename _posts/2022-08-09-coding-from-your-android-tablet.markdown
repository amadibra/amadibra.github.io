Not too long ago i bought first tablet for myself, i choose samsung s7+ after reading and watching many reviews about some options that i can buy. Initially my purpose for buying this is just purely for entertainment, wathing youtube, netflix, twitch as well as playing game. Having bigger screen compare to your regular phone definitely can step up the experience that you got, and i do feel enjoying those activities from my tablet now.

After having and using this tablet for a while, i try to think to have more productive activities that i can do with this "investment" :), and i was thinking that it might can help me to those simple "coding" stuff like blogging. I tried few methods to do blogging from my tablet, from using its native editor, to using online web-based editor like editing from my github repository directly, non of which feels comfortable for me. So i tried to find a way to make it more "developer" friendly, until i found the best setup i can use for my blogging (at least up till now). Here are my setup:

1. Samsung Dex
   It is very specific to samsung brand, this feature not available on other tablet brand, but maybe your tablet has similar feature that can be used. Basically this feature allow samsung tablet to operate similary to desktop. The theme, functionality, shortcuts, etc will be map to be as similar as desktop. With this you get experience to use tablet like using PC.

2. Termux
   I found a terminal that supported on android device. The name is termux. Theme and capability wise are very similar with any other terminal that you used to use on your windows, osx, or any linux distributions. You can also install any packages that you need inside the terminal, some of the tools and packages that available on linux also supported here. You can use `pkg install` or `apt-get install` from termux just like what you use in linux.

3. Vim
   And last for the code editor itself, i'm using Vim. The reasons of it, you might as well read my other article `why vim`. I have explained some of my takeaway about using vim and why it is very good. Luckily so far it works very well too on my tablet.

And thats conclude my setup on my tablet for "mini coding" stuff. I have not do anything much with this, i just started using those recently, hopefully i can get more and more comfortable for using my tablet to be a bit more productive tool.

Cheers,
